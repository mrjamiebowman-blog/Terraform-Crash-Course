# Terraform: Crash Course
I'll teach you how to get started with Terraform very quickly in this article. My main goal here is to focus on a few basic concepts of Terraform so you can install and deploy your very first Terraform script today. This is going to be straight to the point and focused on using Terraform on Windows with Azure. I will demonstrate this in the simplest of ways so that you can grasp the concepts and see this work end-to-end. Before you start, you should also create an empty folder for the workspace for this crash course.
